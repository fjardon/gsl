This file is used by configure.ac to find the directory containing the source
code (AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR directive). Removing this file will prevent the build.

This directory contains the actual source code that gets compiled: 
- Every library should have its own subdirectory. 
- Executables should get their own directory as well. 

If each executable corresponds only to one or two files then it is sensible to 
put them all under the same directory. 

If your executables need more source files, or they can be separated in distinct
classes of functionalities you may like to regroup them under multiple 
directories. Feel free to use your judgment on how to do this best. 

It is easiest to place the library test suites on the same directory with the 
library source code. If that does not sit well with you however, you should put
the test suite for each library in subdirectories under that library's 
directory. It is a massively bad idea to put the test suites for different 
libraries under the same directory.
