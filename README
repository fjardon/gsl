INSTALL
-------

The install procedure uses 'autotool' build system. This means that for most
unixes it should be as straightforward as:

    mkdir ../gsl-build
    cd ../gsl-build
    ../gsl/configure --prefix=$HOME/.local
    make
    make check
    make install

This procedure should work even when using the Windows(tm) operating system, if
you are also using a POSIX layer like Cygwin or MinGW and gcc.

In case you want to use Microsoft cl.exe compiler, the configure step should be
tweaked a bit. After loading the environment needed to have the Microsoft cl.exe
compiler and tools in PATH, configure the build as follow:

    CC='cl' CFLAGS='/MD' \
    CXX='../gsl/build-aux/compile cl' CXXFLAGS='/EHsc /MD' \
    LD='link' LDFLAGS='/DEBUG' \
    NM='dumpbin /HEADERS /SYMBOLS' \
    ../gsl/configure \
    --host 'x86_64-pc-mingw32' \
    --prefix="$HOME/.local/w64"

Then run the usual commands:

    make
    make check
    make install
